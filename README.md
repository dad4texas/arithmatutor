Welcome to the AriThmaTutor.
This app has been put together for the Flatiron Software Engineering School's "Rails Portfolio Project".
The app itself is very similar to stackoverflow. It allows users that are having issues
with specific math problems to post their problems so that other registered users can select to help that student out. Once they have selected to help the student with their math problem, they add their solution to the comments and post it. If the problem is solved the student can either delete the problem or they can go in and edit the problem and deselect active. Doing this doesn't delete the problem, but it is no longer displayed for the other users to see. Then when the student is posting a new problem, they can also select which school they go to, and they name their problem. Also, the user selects from a catagory list, or they can create a new catagory. There are two methods of loging in. First, a user can create an account using their facebook creditials and use the Facebook omniauth, to login, or they can login with the registered account created in arithmatutor.
